## Internship Work Overview

During my internship, I focused on the following areas:

- Frontend UI/UX development
- API integration (Elevenlabs TTS, Deepseek Story Service)
- State management
- App architecture and component design

## Project Directory Guide

This guide will help you understand the parts of the project I worked on.

### Main App Structure
